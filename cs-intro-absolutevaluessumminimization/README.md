# CodeSignal - Intro - 32. absoluteValuesSumMinimization

## Problem

Given a sorted array of integers a, your task is to determine which element of a is closest to all other values of a. In other words, find the element x in a, which minimizes the following sum:

abs(a[0] - x) + abs(a[1] - x) + ... + abs(a[a.length - 1] - x)
(where abs denotes the absolute value)

If there are several possible answers, output the smallest one.

## Example

Given a sorted array of integers a, your task is to determine which element of a is closest to all other values of a. In other words, find the element x in a, which minimizes the following sum:

abs(a[0] - x) + abs(a[1] - x) + ... + abs(a[a.length - 1] - x)
(where abs denotes the absolute value)

If there are several possible answers, output the smallest one.

## Input/Output

[execution time limit] 4 seconds (js)

[input] array.integer a

A non-empty array of integers, sorted in ascending order.

Guaranteed constraints:
1 ≤ a.length ≤ 1000,
-106 ≤ a[i] ≤ 106.

[output] integer

An integer representing the element from a that minimizes the sum of its absolute differences with all other elements.
